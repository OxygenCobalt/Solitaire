# Solitare

A relatively basic Solitaire game. Made as my final project submission for CSCI200.

**Note**: If you are trying to find a final project to plagarize for CSCI200, please don't. Paying 15-30k for a semester at this school
only to be expelled for copying someone elses code is considered a massive L.

## Building

1. Install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org), which is required to build the project.
2. Clone the repository and run `make` in the root folder.
3. Run `./FP` to start the program.
